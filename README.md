# Favorite movie from the summer
- I really enjoyed watching Inside Out 2 with my friends over the summer. We went to the new AMC theatre in Topanga mall and went shopping afterwards.
# Summer travel experiences 
- I did a road trip to Yellowstone National Park and really liked the gysers. We also passed by Jackson Hole, a small town in Wyoming, and ate really good potatos when passing by Idaho.
- I also took a boat to Catalina Island. It was very beautiful, and my family rented a golf cart to tour around the small town of Avalon.
# Learning experiences 
- I took health over the summer and learned about the human body. I also attended a CPR class in order to know how to help someone when they are unconcious. 
# Sports
- I joined a summer softball All Stars team in order to further imporve my skills over the summer. We did many tournaments in places like North Torrance and Santa Monica.
# Goals for this school year
- I would like to stay on top of my assignments this year and pass all my AP tests. I also want to make sure I keep a good balance between school, sports, and friends and family.
